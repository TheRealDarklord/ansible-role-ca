=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-ca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-ca)

Install and configure a certificate authority on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  vars:
    httpd_ignore_docker: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.buildtools
    - role: robertdebock.epel
    - role: robertdebock.python_pip
    - role: robertdebock.httpd
    - role: robertdebock.ca

```

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```
---
# defaults file for ca

# A passphrase for the CA key.
ca_passphrase: SuP3rS3creT

# The common name for the CA.
ca_common_name: example.com

ca_requests:
  - name: certificate1.example.com
    passphrase: S3creT

# Where to publish the certificates, normally a webserver location.
# If not specified, certificates will not be published.
# {{ httpd_data_directory }} is inheritted from the role robertdebock.httpd.
ca_publication_location: "{{ httpd_data_directory }}/pub"

# To update packages this role places on the system, set `ca_package_state` to `latest`.
ca_package_state: present

# Some Docker containers do not allow managing services, rebooting and writing
# to some locations in /etc. The role skips tasks that will typically fail in
# Docker. With this parameter you can tell the role to -not- skip these tasks.
ca_ignore_docker: yes

```
